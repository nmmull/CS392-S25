<p>
<i>CAS CS 392: Rust, in Practice and in Theory</i> is a course about Rust,
a type-safe, memory-safe PL that is becoming a popular alternative to
C and C++ in settings where performance and memory usage are major
concerns.  It's self-described as having "high-level ergonomics" and
"low-level control". Practically speaking, this means clear, concise
code with fewer memory bugs.  Theoretically speaking, this means the
use of a rich type system based on the notion of linearity to enforce
memory-safety before any code has actually been run.
</p>

<p>
Despite its popularity, Rust is still daunting to learn, even for
experienced programmers.  There are several concepts in Rust that
don't appear in any other popular languages.  And even if you become a
proficient Rust programmer, you may not have a deep understanding how
Rust works, or why it is a better alternative to other low-level
languages.
</p>

<p>
In this course, we'll spend the first half of the semester learning
Rust.  We'll spend the second half implementing a subset of Rust <i>in
Rust</i>.  This will help us better understand the details of Rust's type
system and borrow checker.

<p>
<b>Please read this section carefully.</b> This is a new course.  It's the
first time I'm offering it, it's on a quite modern topic and, to be
frank, I'm not sure how well it's going to go.  All of this is to say:
if you're looking for a streamlined course experience, then I don't
recommend taking this course.  This course will require a level of
academic independence and maturity that I expect of advanced
undergraduate students.  There's going to be experimentation, some
things that work, some things that don't, some things with bad
documentation, some things that will require you to look things up
outside of the course material (gasp).  But if you stick with the
course, I hope it can be a valuable experience for all of us.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgb824937" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgb824937">Course Structure</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb824937">
<p>
<b>Please read this section carefully.</b> This course will be treated as a
hybrid of a <i>flipped classroom</i> and a <i>workshop</i>.  Each lecture will
have corresponding readings which you will be expected to have read
<i>before</i> lecture, and which will be required to answer pre-lecture
quizzes.
</p>

<p>
The first part of lecture will be dedicated to a short overview of the
day's topic.  Each lecture will have corresponding discussion
questions.  <i>I want you to think of this part of lecture as closer to
your standard humanities course</i>.  It should be a high-participation
discussion, with live-coding and board work.  It's during this part
that you should make sure you're on the same page as everyone else
with respect to the material.
</p>

<p>
The second (primary) part will be dedicated to working with the
material from the reading.  This will almost always just mean working
on the homework assignments.  This means that homework assignments
will be long, but you will have lots of opportunities to work on it
with other students in the course and get help.  During this part, you
will be encouraged to work in groups of 2-4.  Ideally, you'll be able
to create a small group that you can work with consistently.  Of
course, this does not mean that you can cheat (see below for cheating
policies) but I want you all to help each other as much as possible.
</p>

<p>
<b>Lectures are required</b>.  You are allowed to miss a handful of
lectures due to conflicts, but the structure of this course only works
if you want to participate.  If you feel like you can't do this (be it
because of social anxiety, depression, family conflicts, etc.) then we
can have a conversation and see what other options there are.  But
this does mean that you have to advocate for yourself.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org3b24c73" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org3b24c73">Prerequisites</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3b24c73">
<p>
The formal requirements of this course are <i>CAS CS 320: Concepts of
Programming Languages</i> and <i>CAS CS 210: Computer Systems</i>.  You'll
have the best time with this course if you took CS320 during the Fall
2024 semester.  It is not strictly a requirement, but if you didn't,
then you'll have to catch up a bit on the type theory part of the
course. We'll have a crash course on this after the spring recess, but
it will likely take some time and effort outside of class to master
this material.  Ideally, we should be able to create groups in which
at least one member has this experience.
</p>

<p>
The dependence on 210 is quite mild.  You need to be comfortable with
the terminal, and you need to have some sense of low-level memory
management.  That said, the more versed you are in systems, more
you'll get out of learning Rust.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga21b5a7">
<p>
During the first part of the course, there will be weekly programming
assignments, made up either of (1) a collection of programming
exercises or (2) a small tool you'll need to build in Rust.  There are
8 assignments total.  Two of your lowest assignment grades will be
dropped.
</p>

<p>
The assignments will be somewhat long but, as was mentioned above, we
will work on them during lecture in a group setting.  The hope is that
you'll be able to finish most of the assignment during lecture.

<p>
The midterm exam will be held on Thursday March 6th during class.
This is right before the spring recess so plan accordingly.  The exam
will be on the fundamentals of Rust.  I don't expect it too be
difficult, it is meant to ensure that you are ready to build a large
program in Rust during the second half of the semester.

The bulk of the grade in this course will be dedicated to the final
project.  As mentioned above, the final project is an interpreter for
a subset of Rust written in Rust.  There will be 4 parts to the
project
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A parser</li>
<li>An evaluator</li>
<li>A type/borrow checker</li>
<li>An extension of your choosing</li>
</ul>

<p>
You will expected to submit your own work but, as with the
assignments, you will also be expected to work in a small group and
complete much of the project during lecture.  More will be released
during after the spring recess.

on Piazza, ideally publicly.  I will not respond to emails about
course material.  A couple basic Piazza policies:
</p>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Don't ask homework questions directly.</b> Formulate a question which
will aid in your understanding, and will hopefully help others as
well.</li>
<li><b>Don't give homework solutions directly.</b> The answer-provider is
just as culpable as the answer-receiver in cases of cheating.</li>

Piazza, but don't hesitate to answer questions yourself.</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org23b0e06">
<p>
As mentioned above, there's going to be a lot of group work in this
course.  My collaboration policy is pretty simple: work in groups,
talk about solutions, but <b>never</b> send someone your work, copy-paste
your work, or let someone copy your work.  I will be checking for
code-similarity, and notable cases will be investigated.  If you
collaborate with someone you <b>must</b> cite this in your own work.  See
the next section for more details.

<div id="outline-container-org89f32e4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org89f32e4">Academic Integrity</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org89f32e4">
<p>
Please read the BU's <a href="https://www.bu.edu/academics/policies/academic-conduct-code/">academic conduct code</a>. This is taken very
seriously at BU and I take it seriously in the courses I teach.
</p>

<p>
If you work with others, consult materials found on the Internet, or
use an AI assistant, you should cite your sources.  This is a useful
skill in any setting, and so I recommend being as conservative as
possible regarding what you cite.  In any assignment, these <b>citations
should appear next to every corresponding problem</b> (in comments if the
submission is code). Some examples:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I discussed problem 1 and 2 with Leah Smith. She helped me understand X
and Y aspects of the problem</li>
<li>I saw the stack overflow post
<i>stackoverflow.com/questions/6681284/python-numpy-arrays</i> which
informed my solution</li>
<li>I helped Zihan Guo with problem 4. I told them to try using X</li>
<li>I asked chatGPT "what's the largest eigenvalue of this matrix?" but
asked it not to show me how to solve for it</li>
<li>Group-programmed this with Leslie Diggs and then wrote my own
solution</li>
</ul>

<p>
It can be tricky determining when a citation is necessary.  When in
doubt, err on the side of longer, more descriptive citations.  And
again, <b>all parties are culpable</b>.  Those who share their work with
others (this includes sending files and screen sharing) receive the
same attention as those who use that work.  Please email me
immediately if you are unsure about a particular situation.
</p>

<p>
The line between collaboration, abuse of online resources, and
misconduct has become incredibly blurry, and cases are becoming more
difficult to navigate. There are obvious prohibitions:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Don't share your solutions with anyone else</li>
<li>Don't use the solutions of other students</li>
<li>Don't ask homework questions online on sites like Stack Overflow</li>
<li>Don't ask an AI assistant for a solution to a homework question</li>
<li>Don't consult a solution posted online, even to verify your own</li>
</ul>

<p>
It would be unreasonable to believe that these things never happen, or
that I can recognize every case that it happens.  But I have to depend
on the integrity of all my students, which also means that I have to
take seriously cases of academic misconduct if they do unfortunately
come up.  Use your best judgment and remember:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I care about your success in this course.  I provide a number of
avenues to ask for help, please use them</li>
<li>You will have to answer questions on exams without external aids
(and in interviews when you apply for a job)</li>
<li>If you don't know how to start thinking about a problem, <i>it's okay
to ask for pointers on how to start</i> in office hours and Piazza.  I
can't give you any part of the answer, but I may be able to put you
in the right direction</li>
<li>We have safe-guards (like dropped homework assignments) in the case
you are unable to complete an assignment</li>

<p>
Please read BU's <a href="https://www.bu.edu/policies/sexual-misconduct-title-ix-hr/">Sexual Misconduct Policy</a> and review the entire page
for information about talking to someone confidentially about
experiences of sexual misconduct, filing a report, and any other
relevant information.  Above all, you should feel safe, and able to be
productive.  If this is not the case, please reach out to me or
someone else immediately.
</p>

<p>
The university is legally obligated to investigate reports of sexual
misconduct, and therefore it cannot guarantee the confidentiality of a
report, but it will consider a request for confidentiality and respect
it to the extent possible.  I am also required to report incidents of
sexual misconduct and <b>cannot guarantee confidentiality</b>.  I must
provide our Title IX coordinator with relevant details such as the
names of those involved in the incident.

<h3 id="org555a07a">A Comment on Generative AI</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org555a07a">
<p>
We're going to be talking about the role of AI assistants in education
for the next decade, and the truth is that no one knows at this moment
what we're going to do about it.  You are the first generation that
this is impacting, and not just in college, but likely when you leave
as well.
</p>

<p>
This can be a good thing.  You have the ability to shape your
relationship with these tools (even if that means you choose not to
use them, or even to fight against their use).  But as this is
happening, we still need to run courses at universities.
</p>

<p>
It would be drastic for me to prohibit the use of AI assistants, but
they <b>should not be used to solve homework assignments directly</b>.
I've seen some very powerful and creative ways that they have been
used to aid learning.  Some ideas:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Ask explicitly for the solution not to be given</li>
<li>Ask about high-level ideas, like analogies or mnemonics</li>
<li>Ask for explanations about how code works, or why a piece of code is
not working</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you have any other suggestions please let me know.  The point is,
it's possible to use these tools in productive ways.  Remember,
<b>they're not perfect</b>, they can be wrong, it can sometimes be easy to
tell when a solution was produced by an AI assistant, and you won't
have access to them in exams.
